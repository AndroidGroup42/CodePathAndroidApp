### App Description
// Having multiple email applications can be a hassle. Our mobile app will help consoladate multiple emails, into one, easy to use email application. 

### App Idea Evaluation
- Category: Education/Productivity
- Mobile: Use phone number for initial setup/sign in. After making account, need access to differnt email applications, like G-Mail, Yahoo,   and Outlook. Have access to files/images in the phone. Maybe having a personalized passcode (face id, finger id, etc).  
- Story: Students, teachers and even workers have multiple emails for various things like school, work, and  for their personal use. Our application helps put all their emails into one, easy to use application. Helps elimate various cutters of notifications from differnt emails.   
- Market: Our audiance would mostly be students, teachers, or anyone who needs to use multiple emails for various reasons like work, school, and their personal useage. Yes it gives a great boost to productivity for this niche group.    
- Habit: This would be a habit-forming if people use it daily to check their emails. 
- Scope: It would be easy to build the basic framework for displaying and writing emails. However, calling different APIs to our applciation and useing them would be very difficult. People could customize our application from new or existing features from different email apps. This allows them to enjoy features that they find easy to use.
